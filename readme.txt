These last years, digital marketing surveys taught us that that buyers are extremely visual, more than 50% engage in thorough online research before visiting a physical store to make a purchase, and buyers look for personalization and reasons to trust a retailer.

That's why Google Street View (with [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps)) is also an exceptional way to humanize your brand and amp up the trust factor with your customers. [Google Street View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View) allows buyers to put a face to the business name while lending familiarity when they enter the physical location.

Google maps street view is doing more than helping with the research process. It's building trust with customers by offering highly attractive panoramic views from street level positions and by allowing users to browse interior views (Google Street View's platform allows customers to take a virtual tour in your business, which is a great incentive to convince them to come visit your establishment later).

**How to use WP Google Street View plugin?**

After installing Wp Google Street View plugin, you will be asked to create a Google API Key to make it work (see below at **About your Google Maps API).**

Then, you can select between different map types:

- Google Street View only
- Google maps only
- Synchronized Google Street View &amp; Google maps (PRO version)

Enter an address to be displayed with your map. Google autocomplete will help you provide an accurate location. You can also use your Geolocalisation Tool to identify where you are currently located. Longitude &amp; latitude will be detected instantly.

About Google Street View, make sure to adjust/correct the view (Zoom in/ou, point of view) to be displayed to your visitors (in case of 360 ° virtual tour) and save these parameters (in order to show your visitors exactly what you want them to see).

- You can define other parameters as height, width, ..
- Markers, infobox, map styles, layers are also available for Google Maps and synchronized Google Street View &amp; Google Maps feature.
- Click on"Preview tool" to check your map, then Save.

A shortcode will be generated instantly, to copy-paste wherever needed.

Once your map is created and your shortsoce added to your website, you can always modify all details (style, address, etc.) by editing this shortcode on Wp Google Street View / All items. They will apply automatically on your page/post. **If not, clear your cache**.

**About your Google Maps API**

3 steps to get your Google MAPS API in 3 steps

- First, you need a Google Account (Gsuite, Gmail, ...)
- Then, you have to enable 4 APIs :"Places API, Maps Javascript API, Geocoding API and Directions API".

1. Click [HERE](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend,geocoding_backend,directions_backend,places_backend&amp;keyType=CLIENT_SIDE&amp;reusekey=true). You will have to "Select" or "Create" a project (If it's a new project, then give it a name). You should see [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nv2hotzktmapm23/2020-05-25_16-11-37.jpg?dl=0) (screenshot). If not, then it means that you are not connected to your Google account).
2. Give a name to your API KEY and define [KEY](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pr7rr0v8r8lgyst/2020-05-25_16-12-33.jpg?dl=0) (screenshot) and [API](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6u1cb7qp8p0jgo/2020-05-25_16-12-47.jpg?dl=0) (screenshot) restrictions.
3. Copy your API KEY ([here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pr7rr0v8r8lgyst/2020-05-25_16-12-33.jpg?dl=0)) and paste it to  **Wp Google Street View**  setting page.

Not sure? Check [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1UorU1PALk) (video) or [HERE](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for more details.

- Final step; you have to enable "billing" [HERE](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable).  **But don't panic!**  Google provides a Free TRIAL credit of  **300$, by default,**  which is enough (by far) for any website (again, to prevent abuses). Check [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uINleRduCWM) for more details.

We understand that creating a Google Maps API key (or all these steps) could be frustrating but it's absolutely required by Google to keep using their features.
